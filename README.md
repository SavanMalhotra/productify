# Productify.online

Productify.online is a productivity tool that approached the problem of goal tracking in a unique way. Focused on an intuitive user interface, Productify enables users to easily add goals, track progress, receive SMS alerts, and share their progress with their social media feeds! 

## Our Mission

The goal of Productify is to spark accountability and provide motivation for users who might lack a strong support group to keep them pointing in the right direction. Users only are comparing themselves to their past progress, and our unique system detects progress and how far one is from reaching their goals. In the end, it's about making small steps daily, which leads to long-term success!

## Productify Tech Stack

Productify is strategically built to integrate social media with the help of the Hootsuite API. Our objective is to spark a positive conversation within a user's social media feeds to engage the community and generate a support group, ultimately keeping individuals accountable and motivating them to strive towards their goals. We believe Productivity is a key service that will continue to support and grow positive social media usage.

Aside from social media integration, Productify is built using React.js and CSS for the front end web application and uses Google Firebase Authentication and Firebase Firestore to manage user authentication and user data. 

## What We Learned

Through constant team engagement, we sought help from one another and understood that working together on the same tasks allowed us to effectively manage our time and ensure code quality. We also spent the vast majority of our time learning, designing, and building our React.js web app!

## Challenges We Faced

A key takeaway from building Productify was how important additional team members are. Unfortunately, the Productify team could not secure an additional two team members so the delegation of tasks was increased across the two members that were building the App. Moving forward we hope to find other exciting hackers to disperse task delegation and allow us to ship a fully functional service in a short timeframe. 

For this specific project, we were unable to implement a daily reminder feature that would have sent users SMS notifications regarding their daily progress, in addition to a motivational quote. We also looked to successfully deploy our Hootsuite integration to enable users to share their progress through their social media feed using multi-media generated automatically by Productify, pertaining to their specific goal category.
